# Watson Notes App

## A note-taking app for the wishing-to-be-well-organized!

https://watson-notes-app.vercel.app

Watson Notes App is a web application where users can sign in with their google account, compose notes with a fully-built rich text editor, tag them with your own tags (and some tags from Watson NLU!), and search your database when you need to review!

### The rich text editor

Watson Notes App's rich text editor was built using the Slate framework (https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/tree/master/packages/slate-react) and comes with every tool the dedicated note taker may require, from text formatting to history tracking!

### The tag system

Watson Notes App offers a flexible tag system allowing users to build nested trees of tags with which to connect and cross-reference their notes. Need help coming up with tags? Ask Watson for tag suggestions and receive up to 30 keywords, concepts, and entities relevant to your note! (Don't forget that tags are drag-and-droppable! Thanks to the Beatiful-DnD library: https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd )

### Searching your notes

When reviewing past notes, preparing to write an essay, or simply wishing to follow the threads that have dominated your reading/writing use the simple search interface! Pin the notes you find most relevant and search your personal database using simple or complex tag queries!

## Motivations

The chief design goal of Watson Notes App is to make note-taking as rich and rewarding experience and we often want it to be. Even with our best intentions, finding a way to store and organize the notes we take so that we might actually revisit and learn from them is a daunting task. Note-taking software like Evernote (of which I am a big fan) make the act of taking notes easy, intuitive, and satisfying. Other software, like RoamResearch (again--huge fan), harness and develop the brilliant connections that emerge from your thinking/writing such that even stopping to examine the shapes your thoughts make becomes increasingly worthwhile. Inspired by these separate but powerful motivations for note-taking, Watson Notes App aspires to bring them into the same organizational system.

As my personal passion project of a little over a month (for this initial production showcase, at least), Watson Notes App has been my introduction to both React and Javascript. This is to say that there is surely much that could be improved. Like the project and have an idea for an improvement? Make a pull request!
