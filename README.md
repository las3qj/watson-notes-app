# Watson Notes App

## A note-taking app for the wishing-to-be-well-organized!

Watson Notes App is a web application where users can sign in with their google account, compose notes with a fully-built rich text editor, tag them with your own tags (and some tags from Watson NLU!), and search your database when you need to review!

### The rich text editor

Watson Notes App's rich text editor was built using the Slate framework (https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate/tree/master/packages/slate-react) and comes with every tool the dedicated note taker may require, from text formatting to history tracking!

### The tag system

Watson Notes App offers a flexible tag system allowing users to build nested trees of tags with which to connect and cross-reference their notes. Need help coming up with tags? Ask Watson for tag suggestions and receive up to 30 keywords, concepts, and entities relevant to your note!

### Searching your notes

When reviewing past notes, preparing to write an essay, or simply wishing to follow the threads that have dominated your reading/writing use the simple search interface! Pin the notes you find most relevant and search your personal datanbase using simple or complex tag queries!
